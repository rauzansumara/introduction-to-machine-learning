# Introduction to Machine Learning
 
This laboratory will provide you a foundational understanding of machine learning models (linear regression, logistic regression, multilayer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, natural language processing, computer vision, etc.) as well as demonstrate how these models can solve problems in a variety of industries. In addition, we have designed demonstration exercises that will give you hands-on experience implementing these data science models on data sets. This laboratory is conducted under Warsaw University of Technology.
